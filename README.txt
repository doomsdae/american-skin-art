=================================================
Built 2025-11-07

How to preview locally
----------------------
1) Unzip this folder.
2) Open index.html in your browser (double‑click). No build step needed.

Recommended file structure (already set):
/index.html
/images/devin-01.jpg … devin-12.jpg

How to deploy (fast options)
----------------------------
• GitHub Pages (free)
  - Create a repo, upload index.html and the images/ folder.
  - Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → main / root.
  - Your site goes live under *.github.io.

• Netlify (free)
  - Drag the folder into app.netlify.com → "New site from drag & drop".
  - It auto‑generates an HTTPS URL. Add a custom domain later.

• Vercel (free)
  - vercel.com → "New Project" → drag folder or link to repo.
  - Autodeploy with each push; add a custom domain in Project Settings.

SEO & polish checklist
----------------------
- Replace placeholder address/phone/email in the Shop section and JSON‑LD.
- Create a high‑contrast OG image (1200×630) and link as og:image.
- Add a favicon.ico and /apple-touch-icon.png in the root.
- Connect booking (Calendly, Fresha, or a mail form handler like Formspree).
- Compress any new images to ~1600px, 70–80% JPG quality.
- Make sure image filenames describe content (helps SEO).

Content tips
------------
- Keep portfolio consistent: neutral backgrounds, healed shots where possible.
- Avoid faces unless you have client permission or crop appropriately.
- Keep 12–16 best pieces; rotate quarterly to show fresh work.
